Thoughts: 
- Date window of 100, 180 were both producing statistically weak results for the 
AD group. 
- initially thought it might be because proteins just highly fluctuate depending
on each sample, but replicable results for the CO group disproves this possibility.
So likely that it's due to low sample size

- According to this paper, A-beta, tau, p-tau, etc doesn't significantly change 
within a year (12 months) of diagnosis. The serious memory concern group did have
huge fluctuations, but it was due to the lack of data. :

Elementary findings: 
- Top proteins for CO male volcanoplot were surprisingly consistent across all 
dateframes (90, 100, 180, 1500). 
  - upregulated: CGA.CGB3.CGB7.4914.10.1, etc
  - downregulated: KLK3.8468.19.3, DEF104A.5763.67.3
  
- Top protiens for CO age volcanoplot were not as consistent, but NEFL.10082.251.3 and 
  DPEP2.8327.26.3 and a few others were consistent. 

- volcano plots for AD were consistently unregulated, particularly the gender one. 
  - I thought small samplesize, but even 171 doesn't work for 1500 days. 
  - gender doesn't give promising results. 
  - Age has some results, but are surprisingly inconsistent lol

- perhaps it varies significantly for AD patients. 
- Also there are some that are consistently in the same cluster as albumin.
