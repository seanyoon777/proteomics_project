Notes: 


Updates: 
- Combining the datasets with the correct indices took forever, but we eventually
  have good volcanoplots + enriched pathways! 
- I was trying to compare the volcano plots for knight and stanford separately, but
  unfortunately too small sample size to do that. 
- Clustering: previously used ward linkage, but empirically complete linkage is superior! 
- We also have albumin enriched pathways. OCT4 18692474 ChIP-Seq MEFs Mouse 
  appears in both CO and AD albumin cluster proteins. 
  
Thoughts: 
- According to this paper, A-beta, tau, p-tau, etc doesn't significantly change 
within 4 months of diagnosis. The serious memory concern group did have
huge fluctuations, but it was due to the lack of data. :

This could be the justification for using 120 days as our dateframe 

- Perhaps change how we cluster: 
  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-021-02624-8 
  
- The first paper uses average linkage (which performed very poorly) so not sure
- Also, since we're clustering trajectories, not datapoints like the first paper, 
  so not sure how we would be able to adapt that unless we modify the algorithm 
  itself, but that would be a paper on its own...
